# calculator2

Second attempt at building a calculator for the Odin Project foundation course.

I want to take the experience of building the first one and refine it. Also
using more efficient and "cleaner" code. I felt like the first calculator 
was a bit too bodged together and unwieldy!

I also want to try to use different methods from the first calculator for completing 
the project. I stuck very much with what I knew for the first one so this will push
me to learn and understand more different approaches to coding. Don't want to get
stuck/tunnel visioned on just the one way of doing things!
